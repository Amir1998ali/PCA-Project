# PCA-Project

## Overview
This project explores clustering techniques as part of the Incremental Capstone Project series. It focuses on the application of data preprocessing and clustering algorithms to uncover patterns in datasets. The notebook provides step-by-step implementations and insights into the clustering process, with an emphasis on Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Project Goals
- Analyze datasets using clustering algorithms.
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Visualize clustering results to uncover meaningful patterns.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales data, and prepares it for clustering.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implements K-means and hierarchical clustering.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses PCA to project data into lower dimensions while preserving variance.
- **Visualization:** Provides scatter plots and dendrograms to interpret clustering results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - SciPy
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amir1998ali/PCA-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PCA-Project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook incremental_capstone_7.ipynb
   ```

## Results
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA enhanced clustering performance.
- Visualizations provided insights into data distribution and cluster separability.

## Future Improvements
- Test additional clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.
- Apply feature selection techniques for further optimization.
- Extend the analysis to larger and more complex datasets.
